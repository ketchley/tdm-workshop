As academic libraries continually shift to keep up with changing research and pedagogical needs, many are looking at the digital humanities as an opportunity for closer collaboration with faculty and other campus stakeholders. Text mining fosters a natural partnership between library staff, faculty and students by facilitating a research workflow that promotes close and distant reading, project management skills, and critical thinking.

The purpose of this workshop is to familiarize attendees with the basic workflow, terms and output a student or new researcher would encounter when trying to accomplish a text mining project. We will give an introduction to text mining, including: what it is, what’s possible, and how it is being used for research and instruction. In addition to a discussion on the theories and methodologies in the field, participants will get hands-on practice with the major components of a text mining project.

Participants will build mini-projects in order to familiarize themselves with the fundamental steps of text mining: 

* the curation of a textual dataset, 
* digital literacies and critical thinking skills,
* ideating, developing, and Interpreting research,
* the cleaning and preparation of that data, 
* computational analysis, and visualization of results. 

To accomplish these tasks, we will provide a sample dataset, but will also include a list of primary sources (found on the Web and in the library) where they could procure their own datasets. Using one of the most popular text mining and visualization tools used by digital humanists today (Voyant), attendees will work independently to generate visualizations from the texts in their datasets, and answer questions based on their results.

Course history: This workshop was first offered at the DLF conference in 2019, and has been adapted for a fully online/asynchronous format. We’d like to acknowledge the work of Dr. Wendy Perla Kurtz in developing the content, which also draws on a text-mining workshop offered by the University of Nevada Las Vegas.

This workshop is an introductory session covering the basics of text mining where no previous background is required.
