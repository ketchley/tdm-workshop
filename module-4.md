# Module 4 : Text Analysis with Voyant
In this module, you work with a popular text mining tool called [Voyant](https://voyant-tools.org), which is a web-based reading and analysis environment for digital texts. You will explore different ways to examine and visualize your datasets using the platform.

## Module Objectives 
- Upload your cleaned dataset to Voyant.
- X
- Create and edit a markdown file.

## Module Video
The following video demonstrates each of the steps outlined below in text:

The tool is open source, and is widely used by Digital Humanists using text analysis and visualization. It is an ideal tool to experiment with in order to familiarize yourself with the process of importing textual data, analyzing it, then creating and interpreting the results as visualizations. One drawback of the tool is that it is hosted on the McGill University servers, and so its ability to process very large datasets is limited. It is possible, however, to install it on a home or local server. 

Key features include: 

- Importing documents in various formats (plain text, HTML, XML, PDF, RTF, MS Word, ODF, etc.) 

- Several tools for studying term frequencies and distributions within documents and within a collection of documents (a corpus) 

- A full-text reader that supports very large texts and includes interactive features 

- Interaction between the tools that facilitates navigation and exploration at different scales (from "close reading" to "distant reading") 

- A mechanism for bookmarking and sharing instances of Voyant Tools (specific texts and tools) through persistent URLs  

Instructions:  

Upload to Voyant  

To upload a group of documents, you must first create a zip file of your dataset folder  

Upload the zip file to Voyant:  

From the landing page, select the zip folder you have just created.  

Click ‘upload’.  

Voyant will do the work of expanding the archive and processing all of the documents in your dataset. 

Understanding the Dashboard View  

Familiarize yourself with the dashboard. 

List three pieces of information about your content set that you can see at a glance from the dashboard view. 

What are your overall impressions of the Voyant dashboard? Do you find it intuitive and user friendly? If not, what do you find unclear or challenging? 

What is a stopword? [hint: read the ‘help’ documentation] 

How would you add a tool to the dashboard that is not included in this default dashboard view? 

Voyant Suite of Tools 

Voyant provides a range of tools and options for text analysis. What information can you learn from the following tools and visualizations? [hint: Voyant help documentation is useful]. 

Cirrus 

Document Terms 

Mandala 

Contexts 

Choose your own tool 

Explore your DataSet using Voyant 

An opportunity to explore your datasets using the tools embedded in Voyant. The goal is for you to experiment with your data, to customize tool options and to create a visualization or two. 

Your dataset (THIS SECTION CHANGES PER GROUP) 

In this dataset, you will find  

 

Most Frequent Words comparison (THIS SECTION CHANGES PER GROUP) 

Open two Voyant windows: 

Load your entire content set in one window, and load a single text in the other Voyant window. Compare the word clouds. 

Are the most frequently used words in the single document the same ones that appear most frequently in the larger corpus? Describe any differences you observe.  
**Finished?** Navigate to [Lesson 2](lesson2), to learn how to use Markdown to format your text for the web.
