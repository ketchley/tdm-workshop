# Module 4 : Text Analysis with Voyant
In this module, you work with a popular text mining tool called [Voyant](https://voyant-tools.org), which is a web-based reading and analysis environment for digital texts. You will explore different ways to examine and visualize your datasets using the platform.

## Module Objectives 
- Upload your cleaned dataset to Voyant.
- Experiment with different forms of text analysis to investigate the questions you have about your research dataset.
- Visualized and interpret the analysis results.

## Module Video
The following video demonstrates each of the steps outlined below in text:

The tools in the Voyant platform are open source, and are widely used by digital humanists for text analysis and visualization. It is an ideal suite of tools to experiment with in order to familiarize yourself with the process of importing textual data, analyzing it, then creating and interpreting the results as visualizations. One drawback of the platform is that it is hosted on the McGill University servers, and so its ability to process very large datasets is limited. It is possible, however, to install it on a home or local server. 

Key features include: 

- Importing documents in various formats (plain text, HTML, XML, PDF, RTF, MS Word, ODF, etc.) 

- Several tools for studying term frequencies and distributions within documents and within a collection of documents (a corpus) 

- A full-text reader that supports very large texts and includes interactive features 

- Interaction between the tools that facilitates navigation and exploration at different scales (from "close reading" to "distant reading") 

- A mechanism for bookmarking and sharing instances of Voyant Tools (specific texts and tools) through persistent URLs  

## Instructions:  

### Upload to Voyant  

To upload a group of documents, you must first create a zip file of your dataset folder.  

Upload the zip file to Voyant:  

From the landing page, select the zip folder you have just created.  

Click ‘upload’.  

Voyant will do the work of expanding the archive and processing all of the documents in your dataset. 

### Understanding the Dashboard View  

Familiarize yourself with the dashboard. 

List three pieces of information about your content set that you can see at a glance from the dashboard view. 

What are your overall impressions of the Voyant dashboard? Do you find it intuitive and user friendly? If not, what do you find unclear or challenging? 

What is a stopword? [hint: read the ‘help’ documentation] 

How would you add a tool to the dashboard that is not included in this default dashboard view? 

### Voyant Suite of Tools 

Voyant provides a range of tools and options for text analysis. What information can you learn from the following tools and visualizations? [hint: Voyant help documentation is useful]. 

Cirrus 

Document Terms 

Mandala 

Contexts 

- Choose your own tool 

## Explore your Dataset using Voyant 

An opportunity to explore your datasets using the tools embedded in Voyant. The goal is for you to experiment with your data, to customize tool options and to create a visualization or two.
