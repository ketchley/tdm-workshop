 - Create a concept map for your topic. Be sure to branch out at least three layers. 
 - Select a concept on your outer most layer and perform some preliminary research to determine if the level of specificity of this area is actionable for research.   
 - Then, do the 'Who, Why, How, When' activity to develop your research question using that preliminary research and reflection. 
 - Evaluate your research question and write down what you anticipate will be needed for cleaning, tools, and close reading to plan and scope your project effectively.
